# fem-ii-embedded-system
This repository contains the elements to generate an embedded system from scratch.

This repository includes the following projects / directories:

1 - Vivado hardware design for the Enclustra module based on a reference design from Enclusta "Mars_ZX3_Reference_Design_for_FEMII"
2 - The Enclustra build environment "bsp-xilinx" is added as a sub-module and is needed but no modifications in here necessary
3 - The output directory generated from the bsp-xilinx tool set "out_fem_linux"
4 - A reference design for the V7 on the FEM-II module "Femii-Reference_Design" which gives basic functionality to control the FEM-II module.
